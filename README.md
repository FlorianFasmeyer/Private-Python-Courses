# Private Python Courses
This repository contains a selection of files generated and exchanged during the process of instructing my friend, Younes Guibreteau, in coding. The majority of the instruction took place through verbal communication, wherein concepts were elucidated and illustrated using visual aids. Consequently, these files represent a limited excerpt of the comprehensive learning experience. Among these files, you will discover a game independently developed by Younes Guibreteau, accompanied by one of the numerous exercises I assigned.

This course reviewed the fundamentals of programming and went beyond, to object-oriented programming and concurrency.
